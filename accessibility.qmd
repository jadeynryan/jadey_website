Making sure all content I publish on the web is accessible to anyone and everyone is very important to me. While I'm not an expert on web design or accessibility, I am committed to trying my best. 

This accessibility commitment was adapted from [Silvia Canel√≥n's excellent blog](https://silviacanelon.com/accessibility).

## Feedback

I welcome any feedback on the accessibility and inclusivity of my site and content. Please let me know if you encounter any accessibility barriers or areas for improvement and I'll do my best to remedy them.

## Accessibility practices

This site has been designed with the following features in mind:

- A color palette that meets [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) standards for contrast.
- Alternative text for all informative images.
- Readable font faces, specifically to avoid impostor letter shapes and mirroring.
  - Each character in [iIl], [ceo], and [db qp] should all be distinct from one another.[^1] 
  - This site primarily uses `Domine` for headings, `Atkinson Hyperlegible` for body text (developed by the [Braille Institute](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont)), and Fira Code for code.
- A table of contents in the sidebars for easier navigation.

I use Google's [Lighthouse accessibility tests](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/) to check the accessibility of my website at each deployment. While I would love a perfect score of 100, I commit to a score of at least 80. The Quarto GitHub has quite a few open [GitHub issues with accessibility tags](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/labels/accessibility) that I have no control over.

[^1]: Added the [ceo] and [db qp] tests from Cara Thompson's amazing [data viz design system talk](https://www.cararthompson.com/talks/nhsr2023-dataviz-design-system/), specifically slide 22: Font inspiration.
