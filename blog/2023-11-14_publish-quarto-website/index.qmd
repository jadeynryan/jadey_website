Thankfully, there are already many amazing resources for building beautiful websites and blogs with Quarto. Instead of adding to that pool of content, I'll demo how I built my website with Quarto, connected to a GitHub repository, and published with Netlify [continuous deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git).

I struggled for hours trying to set up the configurations (and in the right order) so the site would be deployed every time I committed to my GitHub repo. Hopefully this demo saves you some time when you start your own website! :)

As with most tech and dev stuff, there's many ways to do (almost) the same thing. There's probably a better way to do this, so I'd love to hear if anyone has any suggestions!

Keep reading to learn about:

-   options for publishing a Quarto website
-   building a Quarto website as an RStudio project
-   connecting this project to a GitHub repository
-   the first manual Netlify deployment with the RStudio terminal
-   setting up the configuration files for automatic rendering with Netlify bots
-   using Netlify's branch deploys and deploy previews
-   installing the [Lighthouse](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-lighthouse#readme) plugin to audit your site's performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO

# Why Netlify? {.unnumbered}

There are many options for deploying Quarto websites such as:

-   [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)
-   [Quarto Pub](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub#github-action)
-   [Posit Connect](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/rstudio-connect.html)
-   [Confluence](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/confluence.html)
-   [Firebase](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/other.html#google-firebase)
-   [Site44](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/other.html#site44)
-   [Amazon S3](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/other.html#amazon-s3)
-   And of course, [Netlify](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html)

Honestly, I was completely overwhelmed by all the options. I had to think about what was most important to me:

1.  using my own custom domain
2.  continuous integration so I could deploy from version control
3.  easy configuration and maintenance

I checked out what other #RStats bloggers[^1] were using and found most folks used GitHub Pages or Netlify.

[^1]: See my [GitHub stars list](https://github.com/stars/jadeynryan/lists/blogs) for my favorite blogs or Quarto website resources.

After some repo-diving and research, I decided to go with Netlify's starter plan, shown below:

![](img/netlify-starter.png){width="600" fig-alt="Netlify starter stats for my account. Bandwidth is 745 MB/100 GB. Build minutes is 43/300. Concurrent builds is 0/1. Team members is 1."}

I don't think I'll ever get near the starter plan limits, but who knows. I can re-evaluate if/when that time comes.

A major selling point for Netlify are its free [branch deploys and deploy previews](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/). You can configure branch deploys to preview a working branch without touching your site in production. You also can see deploy previews generated from pull requests and merges.

::: callout-note
According to this [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/7730), a similar feature is under development for GitHub pages.
:::

See an [example Netlify bot comment](https://github.com/jadeynryan/jadey_website/pull/10) that includes links to the commit, deploy log, deploy preview URL, and a QR code for mobile preview:

![](img/netlify-bot.png){fig-alt="GitHub merge request. Netlify bot commented a table with links to the latest commit, latest deploy log, deploy preview, and preview on mobile QR code."}

## Important Note about Continuous Integration (CI)

Netlify servers can render markdown and build the website, but cannot execute code. This means all code must be executed locally on our computers and the output must be saved via the [Quarto freeze feature](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze) AND committed to your repo.[^2]

Read this [article](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/ci.html#rendering-for-ci) to learn more about rendering Quarto documents and websites with CI. The article discusses a continuum that extends from running everything locally to running everything remotely on a CI server. The workflow presented in this post sits in the middle:

![](img/ci-continuum.png){fig-alt="Graphic of continuous integration continuum with double sided arrow. On the very left is Local Execution & Rendering where the local machine runs code and renders the site and the C server checks the output is copied from version control to the right place. In the middle is Local Execution with CI Rendering where local machine runs code and saves output in the _freeze directory and the CI server with Quarto installed renders the site. The right is CI Execution and Rendering where the CI server executes all code and renders the site; Quarto and all code dependencies must be available on the CI server."}

If you need to execute code with CI, instead of `Step 4. Deploy with Netlify bots`, you'll need to [configure a GitHub Action](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#executing-code) that installs Quarto, R, and dependencies; executes code; renders the site; and publishes to Netlify.
:::

[^2]: See what happens if you don't have `freeze` set to `auto` or `true` AND commit the freeze outputs in this [issue comment](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1956#issuecomment-1773958407).

# The complete walk-through {.unnumbered}

If you're still interested in creating a website with Quarto and deploying it with Netlify, follow along to get started!

I'm a very visual person, so I really rely on screenshots to understand stuff. I promise this post isn't actually that long -- it just has many images. I hope this helps! :)

# Create a Quarto website

In RStudio, go to `File` \> `New Project` \> `New Directory` to open the **New Project Wizard**.

Let's start with a website. If you'd like to add a blog later on, Samantha Csik wrote a great blog post explaining this process [@csik2022].

![](img/rstudio-project-wizard.png){fig-alt="New project wizard with box around Quarto Website." width="500"}

Choose the name of your directory (which will also be the name of your GitHub repository), check the `Create a git repository` box, then click `Create Project`.

![](img/create-website.png){fig-alt="Create Quarto Website dialog box with a field for directory name and a checkbox selected to create a git repository." width="500"}

::: callout-warning
## Are you new to GitHub?

I'm assuming you already use GitHub and have it connected to your RStudio. If you haven't, please follow the installation instructions in [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) [@bryan2023] and then come back.
:::

You should now be in a RStudio project that has `index.qmd` and `_quarto.yml` open and some new things in your `Files pane`:

![](img/rstudio-website.png){fig-alt="RStudio with index.qmd and _quarto.yml open and many new folders and files in the files pane." width="500"}

Your `Files pane` should be populated with the following:

```         
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _quarto.yml         # Website configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.qmd           # About page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.qmd           # Landing page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-website.Rproj    # RStudio project config file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # CSS file for any custom styling
```

Notice we also have a `Git pane` with all of these files unstaged and no branches are available. This is because we haven't created a repository on GitHub and connected it with this project yet.

![](img/git-pane.png){fig-alt="RStudio Git pane with a box around (no branch)." width="500"}

# Create and connect to GitHub

If you're following along with [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) [@bryan2023], we're using the [`Existing project, GitHub last`](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last) workflow.

Thankfully, we can use the `usethis` package so we don't have to touch the terminal! If you haven't used `usethis` yet, you'll need to do the setup described in the [package documentation](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/usethis-setup.html#install-git).

Assuming you have connected and authenticated your GitHub account in RStudio, you can create and connect your project to a repository with just **two** lines of code Ô∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

```{r}
usethis::use_git()
```

```{r}
# ‚úî Setting active project to '/Users/jadeyryan/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/my-website'
# ‚úî Adding '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store', '.quarto' to '.gitignore'

# * 'index.qmd'
# * 'my-website.Rproj'
# * 'styles.css'
# Is it ok to commit them?
#

# 2: Nope
# 3: Yeah
# 
# Selection: 3
# ‚úî Adding files

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

# ‚úî Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/jadeynryan/my-website.git'
# ‚úî Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch
# ‚úî Opening URL 'https://github.com/jadeynryan/my-website'
```

Your new GitHub repository should open in your browser.

# Connect and publish to Netlify

In order to use Netlify's continuous deployment, we need to connect our Git provider to our Netlify account. If you don't have a Netlify account yet, you can [sign up](https://app.netlify.com/signup) with GitHub.

![](img/netlify-signup.png){fig-alt="Netlify signup page with GitHub login." width="400"}

Once we're logged into Netlify and connected to our GitHub, we can do the initial deployment with the Quarto CLI. In the RStudio `Terminal`, run:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish netlify
```

If you're not already logged in on your browser, there may be an additional authentication step.

![](img/quarto-publish-netlify.png){fig-alt="quarto publish netlify command run in the RStudio terminal."}

This command rendered your site locally, uploaded all the static files to Netlify, deployed and published to your new site! The site overview on Netlify should have opened:

![](img/netlify-site-overview.png){fig-alt="Site overview on Netlify with boxes around the random subdomain name and the status as a manual deploy." width="400"}

Note that Netlify provided a random site name (**`stately-chimera-0c91c7`**) on the `netlify.app` domain. Also, notice that it says `Manual deploys` underneath the site link, meaning it was deployed from the `quarto publish netlify` command in our terminal and not from GitHub.

Click on the link to open your live site!

![](img/live-website.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of live website at stately-chimera-0c91c7.netlify.app."}

## Site domain name

The domain name is the URL or web address to your site. You have two options to rename your site:

-   **Free**: change the random name provided but keep the `netlify.app` domain.
-   **Purchase a new domain**: I recommend buying it directly on Netlify so they handle all the NS1 [DNS](https://ns1.com/products/dedicated-dns) configurations. Or, buy from a domain provider that doesn't use the NS1 DNS zone, or you might go through this nightmare of having to switch DNS zones.[^3]

[^3]: I originally bought a domain from Square Space and could not set my Netlify site to that domain due to DNS issues that I don't fully understand. Here's a [support forum thread](https://answers.netlify.com/t/trying-to-move-domain-from-squarespace-to-netlify/11879) on Netlify with the instructions for pointing a custom domain to a Netlify site. I ended up buying another domain directly from Netlify.

    ![](img/netlify-dns-error.png){fig-alt="An error when trying to add a custom domain purchased from Squarespace. The error says a DNS zone already exists on NS1." width="400"}

    DNS stuff is so confusing. ü´§

### Free domain name change

Let's walk through the free option first.

From the site overview Netlify page, click on `Site configuration`.

![](img/netlify-site-config.png){fig-alt="Netlify website site overview with box around site configuration." width="400"}

Scroll down to `Site information`, and then click on `Change site name`.

![](img/netlify-site-info.png){fig-alt="Site information page on Netlify with button to change site name." width="400"}

Now you can update the site name:

![](img/netlify-change-site-name.png){fig-alt="Netlify change site name dialog box with new name of my-website24.netlify.app."}

Note your site name is just the prefix to the full URL containing `netlify.app`.

### Buy a domain name

If you don't want the `netlify.app` domain, you can purchase your own. Instead of `Site configuration`, go to the `Domain management` part of the site, and then click `Add a domain`.

![](img/netlify-domain-mgmt.png){fig-alt="Domain management part of Netlify site with option to add a domain."}

Type in whatever custom domain you want: there are a bajillion different extensions. [domain.com](https://www.domain.com/domains/new-domain-extensions) lists them alphabetically and has a helpful frequently asked questions section. If your desired name is available, you can register the domain for the listed price.

![](img/netlify-add-custom-domain.png){fig-alt="Add a custom domain to your site page on netlify. It says my-website24.com is available and costs $13.99 for the first year." width="500"}

## New `_publish.yml` file

Now that we're set up with Netlify and GitHub, let's head back over to RStudio. Notice this new file appeared in the project directory when you used the `quarto publish netlify` command:

``` {.yaml filename="_publish.yml"}
- source: project
  netlify:
    - id: b9f73a69-06e7-4de2-9c7b-4f9855b56ba3
      url: 'https://stately-chimera-0c91c7.netlify.app'
```

Notice how it automatically filled in the original random URL from Netlify.

The next time you manually publish from the terminal, it will ask if you want to publish the update to `https://my-website24.netlify.app`. If you enter `y`, it will update the `url` value in the `_publish.yml` file.

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
(base) MacBook-Pro-4:my-website jadeyryan$ quarto publish netlify

```

::: callout-important
If you continue to the next steps for configuring continuous deployment, this should be your last time manually publishing your site with `quarto publish netlify` in your Terminal.

However, if you add any code content, you should still run `quarto render` in your Terminal to update the `_freeze` directory.
:::

# Configure continuous deployment

Now we need to configure several things so Netlify's bots can automatically deploy our site:

-   Add Quarto Netlify plugin files
-   Freeze code output by setting `freeze: auto` in `_quarto.yml`
-   Ignore output directory by adding `_site` directory to `.gitignore`
-   Link Netlify site to GitHub repository

## Configure Netlify plugin

The [Quarto Netlify plugin](https://github.com/quarto-dev/netlify-plugin-quarto) installs Quarto on the Netlify build server, allowing Netlify to build your Quarto website.

Create the following two files in your RStudio project and copy the content below into these files.

``` {.toml filename="netlify.toml"}
[[plugins]]
package = "@quarto/netlify-plugin-quarto"
```

``` {.json filename="package.json"}
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@quarto/netlify-plugin-quarto": "^0.0.5"
  }
}
```

## Freeze computations

We need to [freeze](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze) computations so code only runs locally. When you render a `.qmd` that executes code, the results get saved in a `html.json` file within a `_freeze` directory. This means that R and your packages don't need to be installed on the Netlify server to execute the code.

The `_freeze` directory and all its files must be committed to your repo. Otherwise, the build will fail because Netlify doesn't have R and the dependencies installed to run the code (see the detailed error in my [comment](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1956#issuecomment-1773958407)).

Add these two lines to your `_quarto.yml` file:

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
execute:
  freeze: auto
```

If you need to execute code within a CI service, see the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze) for example GitHub actions.

## Ignore output directory

Because we want Netlify bots to use continuous deployment to build our site, we need to ignore our output directory. To do this, we add the `_site` directory that contains all the rendered website content to our `.gitignore` file. This is recommended in the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#ignoring-output-1) to avoid super messy diffs and potential merge conflicts.

``` {.bash filename=".gitignore"}
/_site/
```

::: callout-note
If you're not following the workflow in this blog post and instead are using the `Local Execution & Rendering` option of the CI continuum described in the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/ci.html#rendering-for-ci), do not add `_site` to your `.gitignore`. You need this directory checked into version control so Netlify's CI server can access this content to deploy your website.
:::

## Link Netlify site to GitHub repository

Now we need to link our GitHub repository to our Netlify site.

On the Netlify site, go to `Site configuration` \> `Build & deploy` \> `Continous deployment` \> `Link repository`.

![](img/netlify-link-repo.png){fig-alt="Netlify site on the continuous deployment page with a box around the link repository button." width="700"}

Choose `Deploy with GitHub`:

![](img/netlify-connect-git.png){fig-alt="Netlify site to connect to Git provider. Options to link site to Git repository for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps." width="500"}

If you're already logged into GitHub, it should immediately authorize and allow you to select which repositories the Netlify app can access.

If this is your first time deploying with Netlify and GitHub, you'll likely need to click the bottom link `Configure the Netlify app on GitHub` near the bottom of the Netlify site. This should open a new window `Installed GitHub App - Netlify` where you can make sure the Netlify app is installed on your GitHub and select which repositories it can access.

![](img/netlify-select-repos.png){fig-alt="Netlify website Link your site to a Git Repository with box around 'Can't see your repo here? Configure the Netlify app on GitHub' link and arrow pointing to a new popup window that allows you to select which repositories Netlify can access."}

After selecting the correct repository, you'll configure the build settings on the next screen. Enter `_site` in the `Publish directory` field:

![](img/netlify-build-settings.png){width="500" fig-alt="Netlify site configuration build settings. All settings are blank except the Publish directory should be set to _site."}

Once you click `Deploy my-website24`, it should take you back to your site overview page and it will now say `Deploys from GitHub` instead of `Manual deploys` below the link.

![](img/netlify-deploys-gh.png){width="400" fig-alt="Netlify site overview with website URL and text 'Deploys from GitHub'."}

## Push a change to our repo

Let's push a change to our repo and make sure it is automatically rebuild and deployed!

I added some content to `about.qmd` and pushed to `main`.

![](img/github-push-change.png){fig-alt="GitHub repository with recent commit 0b8b526."}

On the `Deploys` page on Netlify, we can see we successfully published `main@0b8b526`.

![](img/netlify-published.png){fig-alt="Netlify site Deploys page that shows main@0b8b526  was successfully published."}

Since we pushed directly to `main` and `auto publishing` is turned on, all successful deployments are automatically published to our production site.

You could click `Lock to stop auto publishing` to turn this setting off. This means the site will still build every time you push changes to your repo, but you will need to click a button to actually publish this latest build. This is a good option if you don't want to work in new branches or use pull requests/merges in your workflow but you still want to preview your site before sending it to production.

# Branch deploys and deploy previews

As you work on your website styling, content, and features, you may want to preview what your deployed site would look like without messing up your live site. This is where Netlify's branch deploys and deploy previews come into play!

The table below (adapted from [Netlify's docs](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/)) provides a quick comparison of the differences between branch deploys and deploy preview.

[^4]: Netlify.com \> \[Your website\] \> Site configuration \> Build & deploy \> Continuous Deployment \> Branches and deploy contexts

You can learn more details on the differences between branch deploys and deploy previews in [Netlify's docs](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/).

## Branch deploys

Branch deploys are great if you typically use feature branches in your workflow.

By default, only the production branch (typically `main`) is automatically deployed by Netlify.

To enable branch deploys on other branches, we need to change the branch deploy setting. On the Netlify website \> `Site Configuration` \> `Build & deploy` \> `Continuous deployment` \> `Branches and deploy contexts` \> `Branch deploys` \> Select the `All` radio button.

![](img/netlify-branch-deploy-context.png){fig-alt="Netlify site configuration webpage with the branches and deploy contexts settings open. Branch deploys is set to All instead of None."}

Or, if you only want to use a staging branch, you could select `Let me add individual branches` then enter the name of your staging branch.

Let's create a new branch called `staging` and push a commit with the message 'Testing branch deploy'.

On the Netlify `Deploys` page, we can see our published site is still from `main` but we now have a `Branch deploy` from `staging`.

![](img/netlify-branch-deploy.png){fig-alt="Netlify deploys webpage for demo site highlighting the published site is deployed from the main production branch. Lower on the screen is the branch deploy which shows it was deployed from the staging branch."}

Click on the branch deploy to preview the site with the changes you made on that branch.

## Deploy previews

Deploy previews are enabled by default once you've linked your Netlify site with the GitHub repository. Every time you make a pull request or merge, Netlify's bots will build and deploy your site and then comment on your pull/merge request with the URL links.

From our GitHub repository, let's create a pull request to merge our `staging` branch into `main`.

The Netlify bot will comment all the information for the deploy preview including a link to the commit, the deploy log, preview link, and a QR code to scan on a mobile device.

![](img/netlify-bot.png){fig-alt="GitHub merge request. Netlify bot commented a table with links to the latest commit, latest deploy log, deploy preview, and preview on mobile QR code."}

We can also access our deploy preview from the Netlify `Deploys` page. Similar to the branch deploy, our published site is still from `main,` but we now have `Deploy Preview #2` from `staging`. Remember the #2 just means this was the second pull/merge request in our repository.

![](img/netlify-deploy-preview.png){fig-alt="Netlify deploys webpage for demo site highlighting the published site is deployed from the main production branch. Lower on the screen is the deploy preview which shows it was deployed from Pull Request #2."}

Click on the deploy preview #2 link to preview the site with the changes you made based on that pull request.

# Lighthouse plugin

Another benefit of using Netlify are the integrations with different web tools. The only one I am using so far is [Google's Lighthouse tool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), which helps me to abide by my [accessibility commitment](../accessibility.qmd).

The [Lighthouse plugin](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-lighthouse#readme) audits your site for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO at build time. You'll see your scores for each of these four categories in your deploy previews.

To enable the plugin, go to your Netlify site \> `Integrations` \> search for lighthouse \> `Enable`.

![](img/netlify-lighthouse.png){fig-alt="Netlify integrations page searching for lighthouse with box highlighting the Enable button for the Lighthouse plugin."}

Netlify will then ask you if you're sure you want to install Lighthouse on your website. It's as easy as that!

Now let's push another commit to see our Lighthouse report in the Netlify bot comment.

Notice the original Netlify bot comment was edited so the GitHub pull request conversation isn't overly cluttered.

Our Lighthouse audit showed pretty high scores for each of the categories. You can view the more detailed breakdown to see where you can make improvements.

# Workflow

1.  Add/edit/remove content.
2.  Run `quarto render` in Terminal.
3.  Push changes to GitHub.
4.  Review changes (depends on if you're pushing to `main`, or using the branch deploys, or deploy previews).
5.  \[Optional\]: Edit based on Lighthouse audit scores.
6.  Rinse and repeat!

# Wrap up

I hope you found this post helpful for getting your Quarto website configured with Netlify, GitHub, and continuous deployment!

Since this is my first blog post, I'd love feedback on the style, flow, helpfulness, content, etc. I have a new-found, very deep appreciation for all the bloggers out there! This took quite a lot of time and head space to make a \[hopefully\] cohesive and helpful post!
