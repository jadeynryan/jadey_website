## Hi there! ![](assets/img/JR-logo.svg){.img-va-bottom fig-alt="cat with tail shaped as the letter J next to last name initial R" width="100"}

Thanks for visiting my website -- I'm happy you're here!

I'm the data scientist for the [Natural Resources and Agricultural Sciences](https://agr.wa.gov/agscience) section within the Washington State Department of Agriculture. I've had a long academic journey through the world of nature, with degrees in Biology (BS), Environmental Studies (BA), and Land Resources & Environmental Sciences (MS).

My guiding principles in life are **kindness**, **authenticity**, **sustainability**, and **inclusivity**. I finally feel like I've found my happy place in life working in the environmental data science space and connecting with so many amazing folks in the R and open-source community.

I designed [cat & code themed t-shirts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jadeynryan_rstats-positconf2023-activity-7108591736444112896-o1SR) as conversation starters for `posit::conf(2023)`. The positive feedback led me to start a small business: **the coding cats**. I'm excited to channel my creativity and love for cats, programming, and data science into designs for clothing, mugs, and tote bags. Keep an eye out for my [Etsy shop](shop.qmd).

When it comes to work, I love improving the efficiency and reproducibility of our workflows. I'm also in my element when developing decision-support tools with `Quarto` and `Shiny`. In my downtime, I'm happiest hanging out with my husband and our three snowshoe Siamese cats. We love exploring new food spots and the great outdoors.

Thanks for being a part of my journey. I'm by no means an expert at anything, but I plan on using this space to learn out loud!
