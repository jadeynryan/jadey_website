Introducing {soils}: an R package for all your soil health data
visualization and reporting needs. {soils} provides an RStudio project
template to generate customized, interactive soil health reports. These
reports include plots and tables to show how the participantâ€™s results
compare to simple averages of results from samples of the same crop,
same county, and across the entire project. Any scientist leading a soil
health survey can use {soils} to create custom reports for all survey
participants. Democratize your data by giving back to the farmers and
land managers who contributed soil samples to your survey project. Use
these reports to empower each participant to explore and better
understand their data.
