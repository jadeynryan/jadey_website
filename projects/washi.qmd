Inspired by other branding R packages such as [`glitr`](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/glitr), [`ratlas`](https://github.com/atlas-aai/ratlas), and [`nmfspalette`](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/nmfspalette), `washi` provides color palettes and themes consistent with [Washington Soil Health Initiative](https://washingtonsoilhealthinitiative.com) (WaSHI) branding. This package is to be used only by direct collaborators within WaSHI, though you are welcome to adapt the package to suit your own organizationâ€™s branding. ![](https://github.com/WA-Department-of-Agriculture/washi/blob/main/man/figures/logo.png?raw=true){.img-center width=15em fig-alt="washi logo"}
