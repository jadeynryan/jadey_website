Thank you so much for supporting my brand new small business! It truly means the world to me.

This shop was born from posit::conf(2023), a data science conference with a community of amazing people who happen to love programming & cats. While there are lots of Python, Javascript, and other programming merch out there, there's little representation for the R statistical language! I hope to change that, with my own twist of adding cute cats to R themed designs.

All of my designs are available in any product type. If you see a design you like but want it on something else or would like it personalized, please reach out!
