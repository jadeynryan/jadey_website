### Details

👥 [R-Ladies Seattle](https://rladiesseattle.org/) and [Seattle useR Group](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-user)  
📆 April 20, 2023 // 15-minute talk  
🏨 Seattle, WA  

### Abstract

[R-Ladies Seattle](https://rladiesseattle.org/) invited me to give a talk for the ‘R in the Outdoors’ [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-seattle/). This was my first in-person talk of my professional career! I used this as an opportunity to learn new skills through a personal project. I’ve always had an affinity for the Southern Resident Killer Whales in the Salish Sea. The [Center for Whale Research](https://www.whaleresearch.com/) does a lot of really fascinating and important work monitoring their population. They post their survey data on their website; each encounter with the orcas is a separate webpage. Lately, I’ve been curious and intimidated by web scraping so I decided this would make a great case study and personal project.

I ended up also going to the [Seattle useR Group](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-user) lightning talks meetup afterwards and spontaneously gave the same presentation there!
