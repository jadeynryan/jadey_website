### Abstract

Tired of manually adjusting Quarto reports for different regions, time periods, or clients? Dreaming of using just one template to generate both interactive HTML and static Word/PDF versions of your reports?

Join our workshop to unlock the power of parameterized reporting with Quarto and leave with your own template and examples to modify for your own projects.

Get a sneak preview of what you'll learn by checking out the [slides](https://jadeyryan.com/talks/2023-09-25_posit_parameterized-quarto/) for my posit::conf(2023) talk.

Everyone is welcome to attend. If you're new to Quarto, we recommend watching [Tom Mock's excellent 2-hour introduction to Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4).
