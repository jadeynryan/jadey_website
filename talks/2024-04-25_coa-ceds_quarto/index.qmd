### Description

Join this interactive workshop to learn what Quarto is and its impact on
data communication and sharing. In this session, we will 1) explore how
Quarto seamlessly integrates code and text to create reproducible
reports and presentations; 2) dive into real-world applications at the
Washington State Department of Agriculture; and 3) learn and practice
Quarto functionality through demonstrations and hands-on exercises
covering static and dynamic output formats, markdown syntax, code chunk
options, output theming, and parameters for document variations.
