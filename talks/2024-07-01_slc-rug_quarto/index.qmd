### Description

We all have analyzed data and created visualizations for a report the time-consuming and error-prone way. Likely we’ve also had to present that content with a slide deck. After all that painstaking labor and formatting, have you ever had to re-create the report and slides after an update to the data? Or maybe, you've had to generate variations of these materials for different audiences or subsets of the data?

Use Quarto to improve your efficiency, reproducibility, and sanity by streamlining the process of generating reports and slides. Learn how to reuse content and code, use parameters for different variations, and consistently style your publications.
